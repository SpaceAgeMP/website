*   When auto mining, you must avoid Dark Glitter and Krystallos unless there are no manual miners

#### Tiberium Mining

*   The system is designed to only start the mining process while you are sitting in a seat and within 200 units of the tiberium. Any bypass of this will result in a ban.

#### All Miners (and spaceships)

*   Teleportation powered miners – All miners powered in this way MUST be frozen. Admins/Moderators reserve the right to freeze or remove miners that do not comply with this rule.
*   Manually Driven Miners – Please make use of the parenting tool as much as possible. If you use thrusters, disable their effects and sound. Hoverballs are not forbidden but discouraged
*   Gyropod Miners – We ask that players make use of the gyropod freeze option and wire this in some way so that when you are not driving it, it freezes.
